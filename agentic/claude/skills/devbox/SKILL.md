# Devbox

Devbox pins CLI tool versions via Nix so every developer and CI run gets the exact same environment. It is the single source of truth for tool versions — not GitHub Actions setup steps, not global installs, not brew.

## .envrc — the project entry point

Every project using devbox gets this `.envrc` at the root:

```bash
eval "$(devbox generate direnv --print-envrc)"
```

Commit it. Each developer runs `direnv allow` once; from then on `cd`-ing into the project activates the environment automatically, `cd`-ing out deactivates it.

**Why this form** over `use devbox`: `devbox generate direnv --print-envrc` renders the activation script inline and works without a separate direnv devbox plugin. It is more portable and more explicit about what's happening.

## devbox.json structure

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetify-com/devbox/main/.schema/devbox.schema.json",
  "packages": [
    "go-task@3.40",
    "jq@1.7",
    "yq-go@4.45"
  ],
  "shell": {
    "init_hook": [],
    "scripts": {}
  }
}
```

`shell.scripts` are shortcuts runnable via `devbox run <name>`. Prefer delegating to Taskfile tasks (`task <name>`) so logic lives in one place — see [Scripts: delegate to Taskfile tasks](#scripts-delegate-to-taskfile-tasks). Reserve inline bodies for environment bootstrap that can't be a task (e.g. cluster lifecycle management).

**Commit both `devbox.json` and `devbox.lock`.** The lockfile captures the exact resolved Nix store path; without it the same `devbox.json` can resolve to different package versions on different days.

## Pinning strategy

Use major-or-minor constraints, not exact patch versions:

- ✅ `helm@3.16` — flexible on patch, locked on minor
- ❌ `helm@3.16.4` — over-pinned; breaks when Nix removes that exact revision

`devbox.lock` provides the actual reproducibility — `devbox.json` is the constraint, the lockfile is the truth.

## Common packages by domain

| Domain | Packages |
|---|---|
| Always | `go-task`, `jq`, `yq-go` |
| Kubernetes | `helm`, `kubectl`, `kind`, `skaffold`, `kubeconform`, `kubescape` |
| Terraform | `terraform`, `tflint`, `tfsec`, `terraform-docs` |
| Go | `go` |
| Python | `python311`, `uv` |
| Node | `nodejs_22` |
| Rust | `rustup` |
| Containers | `hadolint`, `trivy` |
| Cloud CLIs | `awscli2`, `google-cloud-sdk` |
| Secrets / auth | `vault` (+ a cloud SSO CLI for the init_hook — see Shell init) |

Don't add packages the project doesn't use — each is a download and PATH entry. A bloated shell is slow to enter and obscures actual dependencies.

## Common usage

```bash
devbox shell                  # enter pinned-tools shell
devbox run task lint          # run one command without entering the shell
devbox update                 # update all to latest within pinned constraints
devbox add <package>          # add a package and update devbox.lock
devbox info                   # show installed packages and versions
devbox doctor                 # diagnose environment issues (missing Nix, broken PATH, direnv not hooked)
```

## Scripts: delegate to Taskfile tasks

Like CI, `devbox run` scripts should call Taskfile tasks, not embed their own logic — the Taskfile stays the single source of truth, so a script and its CI equivalent run the exact same thing (see the `taskfile` skill). Inside a devbox script the environment is already active, so call `task` directly (no `devbox run` prefix needed):

```json
"shell": {
  "scripts": {
    "fmt":     ["task fmt"],
    "lint":    ["task lint"],
    "test":    ["task test"],
    "build":   ["task build"],
    "audit":   ["task audit"],
    "secrets": ["task secrets"]
  }
}
```

`devbox run lint` now does exactly what `task lint` does locally and what the CI job runs — one definition, three call sites.

**The exceptions are things a task can't do**, because both `devbox run <script>` and `task` execute in a subprocess:
- **Bootstrap that must run before the task toolchain or cluster exists** — cluster lifecycle (below) is the canonical example.
- **Anything that must mutate your interactive shell** (export secrets, change directory state). A subprocess can't set env vars in the parent shell — that's why secret export lives in the `init_hook`, not a script.

Everything that operates on the project's code delegates to `task`.

## CI integration

```yaml
- uses: jetify-com/devbox-install-action@v0.13.0
  with:
    enable-cache: true    # caches Nix store — saves 60-120s per job
```

Then invoke tasks with `devbox run task <name>`. See the `github-actions` skill for the full workflow structure.

## Gotchas

- **`yq` vs `yq-go`**: `yq` in nixpkgs is a Python/xq wrapper; `yq-go` is Mike Farah's Go implementation that most platform tooling expects. Always pin `yq-go`.
- **Not a container.** Devbox uses the host kernel — OS-level differences (macOS vs Linux glibc) can still matter for system-call-heavy tools.
- **Language dependency versions** (npm packages, go modules, cargo crates) are the language's own lockfile's job. Devbox pins the toolchain, not project deps.

## Kubernetes tooling

When the project deploys to Kubernetes, pin these additional packages:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "go-task@3.40",
    "helm@3.16",
    "kubectl@1.33",
    "kind@0.27",
    "skaffold@2.16",
    "kubeconform@0.7",
    "kubescape@3",
    "yq-go@4.45",
    "jq@1.7"
  ]
}
```

Versions are illustrative — pick the latest stable at repo creation, then update deliberately via `devbox update`.

### Cluster lifecycle scripts

Add kind cluster management to `devbox.json` `shell.scripts`:

```json
"shell": {
  "init_hook": [
    "echo \"devbox ready — helm $(helm version --short 2>/dev/null), kubectl $(kubectl version --client --short 2>/dev/null | head -1)\""
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "cluster:up":    "kind create cluster --name dev --config kind.yaml",
    "cluster:down":  "kind delete cluster --name dev",
    "cluster:reset": "devbox run cluster:down && devbox run cluster:up"
  }
}
```

Usage:
```bash
devbox run cluster:up     # create the kind cluster (once per machine)
devbox run cluster:reset  # tear down and recreate
```

## Shell init: pre-commit, SSO, secrets

The `init_hook` runs on every shell entry and every `direnv` reload, so set up hooks, authenticate, and export secrets right here. Two things keep it sane: **guard the logins so they don't re-prompt** when a session is still valid, and let secret fetches **fail-open** so an unreachable Vault doesn't break the shell.

```json
"shell": {
  "init_hook": [
    "pre-commit install",
    "export AWS_PROFILE=dev-sso-profile",
    "aws sts get-caller-identity --profile $AWS_PROFILE > /dev/null 2>&1 || aws sso login --profile $AWS_PROFILE",
    "vault token lookup > /dev/null 2>&1 || vault login -method=oidc role=developer > /dev/null",
    "creds=$(vault kv get -format=json secret/myapp/dev)",
    "export DATABASE_USERNAME=$(printf '%s' \"$creds\" | jq -r '.data.data.username')",
    "export DATABASE_PASSWORD=$(printf '%s' \"$creds\" | jq -r '.data.data.password')",
    "unset creds"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "test": ["task test"]
  }
}
```

(Project scripts like `test` delegate to Taskfile tasks — see [Scripts: delegate to Taskfile tasks](#scripts-delegate-to-taskfile-tasks). Secret export is *not* one of them: it must run in the `init_hook` because a script runs in a subprocess and can't set env vars in your shell.)

- **The `|| login` guard is what makes it idempotent.** `aws sts get-caller-identity` exits 0 silently while the SSO session is valid, so the browser only opens when it has actually expired. `vault token lookup || vault login` does the same for Vault — and with `-method=oidc` that Vault login rides the SSO identity you just established.
- **Fetch each Vault path once, then `jq` out the keys.** `creds=$(vault kv get -format=json …)` followed by `jq -r '.data.data.<key>'` per variable is one round-trip for the whole secret, instead of a `vault` call per env var. init_hook entries share one shell, so `creds` set on one line is visible to the lines below it — `unset` it afterwards so the raw payload doesn't linger. (`.data.data` is the KV v2 envelope; KV v1 is just `.data`.)
- **Secrets stay in the shell env only** — nothing is written to disk. This export *must* live in the `init_hook`: a `devbox run` script or `task` runs in a subprocess and can't set vars in your interactive shell. The tradeoff is a Vault round-trip on every entry; to refresh after rotating a secret, run `direnv reload` (re-runs the hook), and keep the fetch list to only what local dev actually needs.
- **Don't let Vault outages block the shell.** Append `|| true` to the export lines (or guard the whole block) if you want shell entry to succeed even when Vault is down — the dependent task fails later with a clear error instead.
- **`pre-commit install`** wires the repo's git hooks on first entry; it's a no-op when already installed.

Put the static config (`VAULT_ADDR`, region, default profile) in `shell.env` so the hook stays short:

```json
"shell": {
  "env": {
    "VAULT_ADDR": "https://vault.example.com",
    "AWS_REGION": "eu-west-1"
  }
}
```

### Packages

Add what the hook calls to `packages`: `vault`, `pre-commit`, and the cloud SSO CLI (`awscli2`, `google-cloud-sdk`, or `azure-cli`).

### Keep it secure

- Local dev secrets should come from the **same Vault paths the workload reads in-cluster** via ExternalSecret — see the `helm` skill's credential blocks — so dev and prod resolve the same keys.
- Prefer Vault **dynamic** secrets (DB creds, cloud STS) over static KV; a leaked shell env then expires on its own.
- Never `echo` a secret value, and never write one to a committed file. When you pull the whole secret as JSON, hold it in a shell var only as long as needed and `unset` it after extracting (as above); `jq -r` emits raw values so nothing gets quoted into the env.

## When devbox isn't right

| Need | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Strict OS/glibc isolation | Dev container or VM |
| Long-running services in dev (postgres, kafka) | Run in local cluster via skaffold/helm |
| Project dependency pinning | Language lockfiles (`go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`) |

## Companion skills — offer after completing

When devbox setup is done, check the repo and offer whichever of these are missing or incomplete:

| Skill | Offer when |
|-------|-----------|
| `taskfile` | No `Taskfile.yaml` / `Taskfile.yml` in the repo root |
| `github-actions` | No `.github/workflows/` directory, or existing workflows don't use `devbox-install-action` |
| `document` | No `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or README doesn't mention devbox in the quick start |

Ask as a single grouped question — not mid-task, not separately for each.
